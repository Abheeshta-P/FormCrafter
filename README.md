# FormCrafter

FormCrafter is a simple, user-friendly form creation platform that allows authenticated users to create, manage, and view forms. It provides an interface to log in, access the dashboard, and perform form-related tasks.

## Features

- **Login**: Allows users to authenticate and access their dashboard.
- **Dashboard**: After logging in, users are redirected to a dashboard where they can:
  - View a list of forms.
  - Create new forms.
- **Create Form**: Users can create new forms via an easy-to-use form builder interface.
- **View Forms**: Users can view and use their previously created forms.
- **Logout**: Users can log out of the platform from the header.

### Folder Structure

```
/src
│
├── /components        # Reusable components (Input, Button, Header, etc.)
├── /features          # Redux slices for state management (authSlice.js etc.)
├── /pages             # Pages for different routes (LoginPage, Dashboard, CreateFormPage, FormListPAge, ViewFormPage)
├── /utils             # Utility functions (for API calls for future use)
└── /App.js            # Main component that sets up routes and layout
```

### Key Files

- **App.js**: Sets up routing and main layout (includes the header, footer, and page content).
- **authSlice.js**: Redux slice that handles authentication (login/logout).
- **Header.js**: Displays navigation options (e.g., Dashboard, Create Form) and the logout button.
- **LoginPage.js**: Handles user authentication and login form.
- **Dashboard.js**: Displays the user's dashboard, including form links and options to create/view forms.
- **CreateFormPage.js**: Allows the user to create a new form.

## API Integration (Future Scope, Frontend is done)

### Authentication

- **Login**: On form submission, a backend API call should be made to authenticate the user. If successful, the user will be redirected to the dashboard, and the login state will be stored in Redux and `localStorage`.

- **Logout**: Logging out will clear the Redux state and remove the login details from `localStorage`.

### Form Management

- **Create Form**: Users can create a form by providing form details, which will be stored in the local storage ( since it is frontend focused for now ).

- **View Forms**: Users can view a list of forms they’ve created, and use those forms.


## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation between pages.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For managing global state (e.g., authentication state).
- **React Hook Form**: For handling form validation and submission.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
